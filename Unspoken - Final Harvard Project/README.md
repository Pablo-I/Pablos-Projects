The following is an explanation of the user's tasks and an introduction to the immersive experience:

We are The Syndicate of the Unspoken, an underground consortium who seeks to uncover the silenced truth. As a new member, read the following so you are aware of the case and the way we conduct business.

On May 14th, 2022, the death of an elderly woman was reported to the authorities. The crime took place in the simple city of Torna, found in a small country known as Bonta. The victim was identified as Beatrice Jones, the wife of a passionate professor who is widely known for his advances in the Biochemical Engineering field, and her body was found in his home office. Unfortunately, Beatrice's death was immediately followed by the renowned professor's disappearance. It is now your mission to unveil Beatrice Jones' killer and to find the missing professor.

Before you begin your investigation, familiarize yourself with your inventory. Don't forget that you have a Map and Notebook at your disposal. The Police Station is where you submit the name of the person responsible for Beatrice's death. During your investigation, to inspect an object more closely, click on it. Note that not all objects can be inspected, so click around until you find some leads. Each object you click on has a description at the bottom of the page, read through these to find some clues.

Look for the following:

Green Text - Means that you have discovered a new location. Whenever you see green text, open the map to see what place you found.

Conduct your investigation wisely, for prosecuting the innocent will result in your immediate elimination, leaving the truth forever Unspoken.



Once the user find the professor, they are allowed to go to the police station and report whoever they believe commited the crime. The following shows the end of game log if they choose the correct suspect:

You successfully prosecuted the correct suspect: Edwin Thorby! Further actions revealed the following to be the full, absolute truth:

Edwin is the professor's nephew, and from a very young age he has helped the old man with all sorts of different projects and experiments. Further proceedings showed that the professor's latest endeavour was called the nexus. Although we have yet to uncover its purpose, we do know that it involved dangerous work, and the professor knew that. So, he rented a cheap laboratory over in New Mexico and sent two interns to test it. Unfortunately, some miscalculations resulted in an explosion that killed both of them. We later discovered that one of the interns, Lucia Croft, was actually Edwin's life-long partner. He blamed the professor for everything...For losing her and the grief it caused him. It was this pain that drove Edwin to seek retribution, resulting in the deaths of Beatrice and the Professor.
